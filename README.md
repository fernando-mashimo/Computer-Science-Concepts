# Computer Science Concepts

Welcome to the "Computer Science Concepts" repository! This repository contains practical challenges that I have written in Python. These challenges are designed to help practicing and improving my knowledge of the Python language, algorithms, time-space complexity (Big O Notation), and various data structures commonly used in programming.

## Challenges

The challenges in this repository cover a range of topics, including:

- **Array Reversal**: Reverses an array. Time complexity: O(n).
- **Palindrome Checker**: Checks whether a string is a palindrome. Time complexity: O(n).
<!-- - **Stack Implementation**: Implements a stack data structure. Time complexity: O(1).
- **Queue Implementation**: Implements a queue data structure. Time complexity: O(1). -->
- **Binary Search**: Performs a binary search on a sorted array. Time complexity: O(log n).
- **Quick Sort**: Sorts an array using the Quick Sort algorithm. Time complexity: O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) in the worst case.
- **Hash Table Implementation**: Implements a hash table data structure. Time complexity: O(1) on average, O(n) in the worst case.
- **Binary Tree Traversal**: Performs various traversals on a binary tree. Time complexity: O(n).
<!-- - **Graph Traversal (DFS)**: Performs depth-first search traversal on a graph. Time complexity: O(n + m). -->
<!-- - **Graph Traversal (BFS)**: Performs breadth-first search traversal on a graph. Time complexity: O(n + m). -->

## Quick Sort

The Quick Sort method is a widely used sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It has the following time complexity:

- Average case: O(n log n)
- Worst case: O(n^2)

The Quick Sort algorithm has a good average case time complexity and is often used in practice due to its efficiency. However, in the worst case, it can have a quadratic time complexity. Efforts have been made to mitigate this issue by using randomized partitioning or choosing a good pivot element.
